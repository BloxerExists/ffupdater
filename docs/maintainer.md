# Maintainer:

## Tobiwan (now)

## Boris Kraut (https://gitlab.com/krt/ffupdater, until April 2019)

> Since I left F-Droid (and Android/Smartphones) about a year ago, I am looking for a new maintainer to take
> over. Unfortunately the upstream issue I opened years ago is still not solved in 2019. While Fennec F-Droid
> is back in the mainline repo and other binary repos do serve Firefox, some might still prefer this updater.
> So as I said: Maintainers welcome. The main task should be to test the last few merge requests (especially
> the background update stuff) and release a new version.
