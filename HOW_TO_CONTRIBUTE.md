# Add new translations

## Advanced developers

Same as above but with forking + pull request / merge requests on [notabug.org](https://notabug.org/Tobiwan/ffupdater/pulls),
[GitHub](https://github.com/Tobi823/ffupdater/pulls) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Tobiwan/ffupdater_gitlab/-/merge_requests)

## Regular check

I'm only a German native speaker with DeepL and Google Translate - expect to check every six months for bad translations.
