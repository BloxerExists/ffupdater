        This is a updater for multiple browsers from Mozilla.
        Click the plus-button for installation and the down-arrow-button for updating.
        By down-swiping or reopening the app you can check for new updates.
        On default the app will check regularly for updates in the background.
        I did my best to secure the installation/updating process - feel free to double-check it or improve it by creating a pull-request.
