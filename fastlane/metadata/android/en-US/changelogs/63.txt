 * There has been a discussion on Github if the Kiwi browser is spyware: https://github.com/Tobi823/ffupdater/issues/35 (Tobi823/ffupdater#35)
   I think that Kiwi is not spyware but stays removed because FFUpdater is about privacy and Kiwi has no additional privacy features.
   F-Droid users can use other stores (like Aurora Store) to install the Kiwi browser.
 * Bug fix: automatically download app updates after disabling airplane mode
 * Bug fix: catch the JobCancellationException correctly (occurs when changing the network during background update check)
